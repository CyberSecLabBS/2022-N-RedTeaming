<!-- Sysmon configuration to aid in lsadump::dcsync module execution analysis

It simply logs mimikatz process creation and termination, for the sole purpose of helping log analysis by clearly
separating different runs. The generated logs then need to be merged with the logs generated on the Domain Controller.
This is due to the fact that different computers generate the logs we need:
- the computer running Mimikatz generates sysmon events for process creation and termination
- the Domain Controller computer generates audit events for domain replication services
